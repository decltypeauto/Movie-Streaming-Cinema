Were you ever curious as to how those 123movie sites, etc, get their movies? 

Well, yeah, i was too. So i decided to do something about it.

I'm assuming they cache each movie when someone watches it, on their server.

But, instead, i decided to use a few movie scraping api's, listed them all on my site, and added a search function.

With this you could then select any movie you wanted, click play, and it would play it for you.

I found a torrent streaming API online which was pretty good. All you had to do was enter a torrent link.

The movie scraping api's returned the movies in json, so all i had to do was parse it and get the torrent link for it.

Boom, you have your own movie streaming site.


This also includes a login/register system (which requires an invite code to register).

Enjoy!

(Also, please ignore the fact that almost all cinema related PHP was throw into one file, lol)
